This is a blank project for TypeScript development with CDK.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

- `npm run build` compile typescript to js
- `npm run watch` watch for changes and compile
- `npm run test` perform the jest unit tests
- `cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template

FFMPEG Runtime: https://github.com/serverlesspub/ffmpeg-aws-lambda-layer

Deploy: cdk deploy

Run: npx ts-node streamAudio.ts

Weird error with lib-cov defaulting even though bundling with env var
